              <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux Security</span></h2>
              <p>Linux has many security features although having a secure
                system depends on setup and having the correct security
                policies.  In practice we have seen that there will always be
                security risk and all you can do is minimize the risk. You also
                have to be aware of basic things such as physical security.  If
                someone has access to the hardware it makes it much easier to
                access data and modify files.  We are going to go over basic
                security and safeguards here.  This is a very big subject and is
                constantly changing and there is no way that I can cover
                everything here.  I will go over best practices and try to point
                people in the right direction. I recommend that you subscribe to
                news letters and visit security web sites to stay updated and
                informed.</p>
              <p><br />
                <a href="networking_security.html">Network security: </a> Please
                visit my network security page for best practices and common
                security issues.</p>
              <p><br />
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Patches:</span>  keep you
                systems updated to the current patch level.  I suggest not just
                using automatic updates on production systems.  Test the updates
                first and then update the production systems.  As you don’t want
                to have production services go down because of compatibility
                issues or bugs.<br />
              </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Passwords and logins:</span>  
                Don’t keep the same password on you systems for years as this
                greatly increases the chance that someone my get the password
                with brute force or social engineering.   Just changing you
                passwords every couple of months greatly reduces risk.  Also use
                a good password, random charters are best but as no one can
                remember them, this means that it is more likely it is written
                down some ware.  Try to string several words together with
                numbers, upper/lower case and symbols in a way that kind of
                makes sense and you can remember like “Us3A,g00dp4ssw0rD!!!”</p>
              <p> Turn off logins for default users including root.  This
                greatly reduces the chance of someone getting into the system as
                they need to guess a usersname and password.  Us the su command
                or better yet sudo for root access.  You also should not have
                the root password set the same as a user’s password.</p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">SSH and tunneling:</span>  
                Another security risk is SSH tunneling.  Most Linux systems
                support tunneling to any system on any port over SSH unless this
                has been turned off.  You may think that all you are doing is
                giving someone an SSH login to a system, where in realty you
                just gave them access to you hole network.  You turn this off in
                the “sshd_config” file with the following settings; 
                “AllowTcpForwarding no” and  “X11Forwarding no”.  Remember that
                if they have root access they can turn this back on.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Services:</span>  Don’t run
                daemons or services that you don’t need or use as it just adds
                risk.  When setting up services read up on security issues.  You
                can have a secure version of software like bind or sendmail and
                if the configuration is not done correctly you can have security
                issues.  It may also be a good idea to run vulnerability
                scanners against the systems especially if the setup is new to
                you.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Security:</span>  Number
                one here is physical access.  If someone has access to the
                system they can boot form a CD or USB device and have access to
                the network and files on the system.  You can minimize this risk
                by limiting access to server rooms and locking doors.  You also
                can set bios passwords, disable booting from devices and lock
                cases.  This at least helps.</p>
              <p> If you have sensitive data on a system not in a secure
                computer center you can have an encrypted file system for the
                data.  In general I don’t recommend encrypting the whole hard
                drive as it makes it harder for fix issues and slows down the
                system.  The best approach is an application that encrypts the
                data with a strong encryption before storing it.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Logs:</span>  Use log analysis
                tools on you servers.  Analyzing logs is one of the best ways to
                find security issues especially on servers.  Looking at logs by
                hand is ok although you can easily miss something.  I recommend
                having a tool that gives statistics and top user, errors, … by
                time of day.  Looking at logs for non-business hours is also a
                good way to spot issues and any traffic is suspicious at these
                times.</p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Software: </span> Don’t load
                software or packages that you don’t need on especially on
                production servers as it just adds risk.  I see request for
                things like PHPadmin on web servers all the time.  Not having
                additional packages can eliminate many security issues.  Do run
                things like tripwire and root kit revilers that detect changes
                and report security issues. </p>
