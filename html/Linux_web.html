              <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux Web Servers and
                  Applications</span></h2>
              <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web server overview</span></h3>
              <p>The number one web server is Apache and the number 2 web server
                is NGINX.
                Both are excellent choices NGINX being the newer and is easy to
                configure for modern apps and services. Red hat and Debian use
                Apache web servers by default and is the most used so we are
                going to go over basic Apache configuration and set up in Linux.
              </p>
              <p>As I have stated, when planning for any service you want to
                take performance and up-time into into consideration.  This will
                nominally involve having a load balancer of some type in front
                of the web servers, as this gives you both redundancy and the
                ability to increase capacity as needed by adding servers. You
                can also use something as simple as <a href="http://www.keepalived.org/">keepalived</a>
                with a VIP and have an active/standby setup.  One can also
                consider using a cloud service for you application hosting. 
                With most cloud services you can increase capacity on demand and
                they offer centralized data storage.</p>
              <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Apache Setup</span></h3>
              <p>By default all the web sites HTML pages and scripts are in
                /var/www.  You can change this although it can be useful to have
                everything in the default dir, especially if you are using
                someone's pre-canned application.  One can also argue that it is
                better to change this for security.  </p>
              <h3> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Files</span></h3>
              In Red Hat the configurations are in /etc/httpd/conf and it
              generally users one file httpd.conf  This is not the standard for
              Apache and had been modified by RedHat.  Debian uses a standard
              Apache load and the configuration files on in /etc/apache2 with
              the main config in apache2.conf and the network configuration in
              ports.conf.  The variables are the same just the names and
              location of the files have been changed.<br />
              <br />
              Verify that that the web server is listening on the correct port
              and IP in the config file.  The "Listen" argument sets what IPs
              and ports the server responds to.  If you want the web server to
              respond on all IPs just give it the port number "Listen 80"  Or
              you can give it the IP of the interface the web services is on ":"
              and a port number "Listen 192.168.1.100:80".  <br />
              <br />
              For Red Hat you need to run setup and turn on the httpd service or
              you can start it by hand.<br />
              <br />
              Once this is set you can put your docs in /var/www/html for RedHat
              and /var/www for Debian and standard Apache installs.  Then you
              are ready to go, the service will start by default when the server
              is booted. <br />
              <br />
              <h3>Apache HTTPS Setup</h3>
              We will go over certificate generation and basic HTTPS setup. 
              This will cover most Linux systems although the Apache
              configuration files and locations may very depending on the
              distribution you are using. <br />
              <br />
              To generate a CSR (Certificate signing request) for either a
              self-signed certificate or a PKI certificate authority, run the
              following command.  When asked for the name this is the official
              name of the web server not the host name.  So if you are going to
              HTTPS://myserver.mydomain.com you would put
              “myserver.mydomain.com” as the name.<br />
              <br />
              <div id="Data"> openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout
                myserver.key -out sercer.csr</div>
              <br />
              To generate a self-signed certificate run the following command or
              you can get a certificate from a certificate authority using the
              CSR that you generated with the above command.<br />
              <br />
              <div id="Data"> openssl x509 -in sercer.csr -out myserver.crt -req
                -signkey myserver.key </div>
              <br />
              Now that we have a key and a certificate we can set up HTTPS on
              the server. Copy the files into the apache or system certificate
              dir. Go to the Apache directory (normally /etc/apache2 Centos and
              Redhat /etc/httpd). The location of the key and certificate files
              should be in either httpd.conf or under the vhosts.d directory in
              a conf file, or for RedHat in conf.d/ssl.conf.  You aneed to have
              the following lines in the config file.<br />
              <br />
              <div id="Data"> &lt;IfDefine SSL&gt;<br />
                &lt;IfDefine !NOSSL&gt;<br />
                &lt;VirtualHost Your_IP_Address:443&gt;<br />
              </div>
              <br />
              In /etc/syscofig/apache2 or the equlvent file on you server you
              may need the following line<br />
               <br />
              <div id="Data"> APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS="SSL"<br />
              </div>
              <br />
              Restart you web server and you should have HTTPS access.  You also
              may want to disable HTTP or redirect HTTP to HTTPS.<br />
              <br />
