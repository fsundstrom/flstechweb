              A virtual LAN or VLAN is a logical LAN on a network segment.  A
              network segment can have multiple VLANs.  Each VLAN is assigned a
              VLAN number with a max of 4094 VLANs on a network (i.e. VLAN
              1-4094).  Each packet has the VLAN number in the layer 2 header as
              per the IEEE 802.1Q spec.  As this is a layer 2 feature it is
              protocol independent.<br />
              <br />
              VLAN packets are ether routed by the local switch, router or by
              the local systems network stack.  In most cases it is the switch
              that routes packets for a particular VLAN to the host on that
              port.  This has an added advantage as VAN compliant switches only
              send traffic to VLANs assigned to a port.  When a switch port is
              configured for a VLAN the switch tags all packets received form
              the host with the VLAN number.  You can also set up a port on a
              switch as a trunk allowing VLANS to span multiple switches or
              routers.  When you set up a trunk on a port you can assign what
              VLANs are trucked through the port allowing routing of VLAN
              traffic.<br />
              <br />
              VLANs are very useful for separating traffic on a network.  This
              gives many advantages including security, broadcast filtering and
              increased capacity on a segment.  One of the advantages of VLANs
              is that a switch only handles broadcast packets for the VLANs
              assigned to it.  Each VLAN is just like having an independent LAN
              and needs to be routed and administered separately.  For instance
              if you are using DHCP, systems on that VLAN must have access to a
              DHCP server.  As traffic including broadcast packets is not
              bridged between VLANs.<br />
              <br />
              Network backbones commonly use VLANs.  You can have a 10 Gig
              backbone network attached to slower local LANs and separate the
              traffic on the backbone with VLANs.  For VOIP you can have a VLAN
              with a high QOS and isolate the traffic going to local VOIP
              switches.  This gives improved connectivity as traffic from local
              LANs is isolated on the backbone.  You could do this by having
              multiple network runs all the way back to your central routers. 
              Although it would cost more and be harder to manage then having a
              single physical backbone. <br />
              <br />
              VLANs are also very useful for test environments where you need to
              have separate network segments.  You can have multiple
              environments on the same set of physical switches without the need
              to rewire everything for different setups.  VMware also has the
              ability to handle VLANs on their virtual switches and with virtual
              routers, load balances, etc. You can have quite a complex test
              environment with a minimum amount of hardware.  If you add Linux
              systems with traffic control or other network simulators you can
              easily simulate large WAN environments.<br />
