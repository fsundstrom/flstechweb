              <p>There are many choices for a small single board Linux system. 
                I had several requirements.  It needed to be small, lightweight,
                easy to use and have the needed I/O as well as audio.  At the
                time the clear winner was the Respberry Pi.  Today we also have
                the newer BeagleBoard systems and others that are as small as
                the Pi.  </p>
              <p>Both the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBoard have good I/O
                options.  If you just want to get going fast the BeagleBoard has
                better I/O and many add on boards for almost anything you may
                want to build.  Although there are now others that I would be
                considering. The UDOO is a Linux board with a 4 core processor
                and a built in Ardunio mega look a like.  There are also others
                with this arrangement.  Giving you what I have built; a Linux
                system with an attached microcontroller for I/O, all in one
                board!  Looks like one of these may be in my next project.</p>
              <h5><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande',Arial,Sans-Serif;">Raspberry
                  Pi <br />
                </span></h5>
              <p>I am using the raspberry pi running Raspbian Linux, based on
                Debian.  It  has a USB WiFi adapter and runs a web server for
                communications over XML.  The other USB port goes to the Ardunio
                mega that I use for all the I/O.  I also have a camera and the
                next step is a small GPS board.</p>
              <p>Most of my code is written in Perl and C so I am not using a
                lot of CPU.  Performance is good, nothing to complain about.  As
                the Linux is based on Debian all the needed packages were easily
                installed with apt-get.  Backups are easy you just copy the
                memory card to a image.  I am using a 16Gig card so space in not
                a big issue. </p>
              <p>Installation was easy you just copy the image to the memory
                card and when it boots up for the first time, it expands the
                drive to the size of the memory card.  Next you use apt-get
                update to get the newest files (just like any Debian install). 
                By default it runs a GUI interface on the built in HDMI
                connector with support for USB keyboard and mouse.  The built in
                Ethernet interface is set to DCHP an IP address by default.  As
                the system was going to be used as a server I disabled the GUI
                in /etc/inittab and changed the memory model per the
                instructions on the Raspberry Pi site. </p>
              <p>For the communications to the Ardunio I installed the Ardunio
                library/tools and used a USB cable and the virtual serial port. 
                I did have to change the getty statment in the inittab.conf file
                not to use the same port.  A slicker way to do this is to use
                the hardware serial port on the Pi with a voltage converter
                attached to the Ardunio's hardware serial port.  This would free
                up a USB port. </p>
