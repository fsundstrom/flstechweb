              <h4>Redundancy</h4>
              <span style="font-family: Arial,Sans-Serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Let's
              start with redundancy.  One must expect things to fail so the best
              practice is to plan for failure.  In this way we can keep the
              needed data and services available when nodes or links fail.  So
              the question is how long can something be down for.  In general
              the higher the availability the greater the cost.  So for instance
              It may be ok to recover a lab in a few days, in this case all we
              need is backups.  While a primary web site or network links
              required for business may need to be mirrored with complete site
              redundancy.<br />
              <h4>The N+1 model </h4>
              For services such as Web, DNS, Mail, Proxy ... the N+1 model is
              very useful as we can add capacity along with redundancy.  With
              this model we load balance the request between multiple servers. 
              <br />
              <br />
              One of the most basic ways to do this is with DNS.  For services
              like SMTP it is built in to the MX records where we can have
              multiple servers with different <span style="font-size:9.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;color:#333333;background:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">weights</span>. 
              you can also give an "A" or in the case of IPv6 "AAA" record more
              then one IP and the DNS request will rotate through the IPs. 
              Having<span style="font-size:9.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;color:#333333;background:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">
                multiple</span> A or AAA records does pose an issue where if one
              of the IPs goes down a percentage of request will fail.<br />
              <br />
              To stop having up to 50% of request frail (i.e. if we have 2
              servers and 1 goes down).  We can have load balancers that are
              service aware (F5 and A10 for example), so that when a node has
              problems it is taken out of rotation.<br />
              <h4>Mirroring</h4>
              Mirroring  is one of the simplest ways of adding redundancy.  The
              major disadvantage of mirroring is cost as we will have hardware
              that is not being used sitting around until we need it.  In some
              cases where we don't need or can't use the extra capacity of N+1,
              mirroring makes the most sense. <br />
              <br />
              A VIP (virtual IP) or floating IP is one of the easiest way to
              mirror systems.  To do this we would set up a cluster of some kind
              and assign the active node the VIP.  When something happens the
              the active node the other node in the cluster becomes active and
              is assigned the VIP.<br />
              <br />
              <h4>ASNs and BGP </h4>
              <p>When we are looking at site or ISP redundancy we may need to
                change the routing to entire pools of IP address associated with
                an ASN.</p>
              <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">BGP
                (Border Gateway Protocol) is the method used for routing ASNs. 
                Each router on the edge of the internal network runs BGP and
                advertises its routes and receives routes via the BGP protocol. 
                BGP is normally set up in a mesh where each router on the edge
                of the internal network has routes to the other BGP members with
                the same ASN.  In some cases you may want to have routers in you
                network that recive the BGP routing information but are not part
                of the mesh in this case you may set up your border routers as
                route refelcters where they will tell the internal routers the
                BGP routes assigned to them without needing to have the internal
                routes as part of the BGP mesh.</span>
              <h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geographic location</span></h4>
              By default you will get better performance the closer you are to
              the data you are accessing.  As RTT increases you performance
              decreases.  So it makes the most sense to have the servers closer
              to the users.  So in many cases like having offices in NY and LA
              it may make sense to have local servers in both locations that
              then sync their data between the sites as a back office task.<br />
              <br />
              RTT time and the affect it has on the application can very, the
              biggest issues is the number of round trips needed for each
              transacton.  If you are just sending files it may not be that big
              an issues.  On the other hand if you have an interactive
              application that is using database queries, you could experience
              performance issues with users that have high RTTs<br />
