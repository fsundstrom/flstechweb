              <h2 style="width: 630px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux
                  configuration basics</span></h2>
              <p>The following shows the command line methods for system
                configuration as the GUI tools are optional and not always
                installed on servers.  Also the GUI tools are quite self
                explanatory If you know what you need to do.</p>
              <p><br />
              </p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Package management </span><br />
              <p>Redhat uses "yum" to automatically fetch and install packages. 
                You can also use yum to update all installed packages by running
                "yum update".  "rpm" is used to look at installed packages or
                install/remove packages by hand.</p>
              <p>Debian uses "apt-get" to automatically fetch and install
                packages.  To update all installed packages you run "apt-get
                update" to update the apt db, then run "apt-get upgrade" to
                upgrade the packages.  To list installed packages or
                install/remove packages by hand you use "dpkg". </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run Levels</span></p>
              <p>The basic Linux system has 7 defined run levels 0-6.  Run
                levels are used to set what services and programs run on the
                system.  Run level 1 is what is called single user mode and is
                used for maintenance.  At run level 1 the system does not mount
                additional drives and has no networking services and just basic
                programs are available. Run levels 2 - 5 are left open for
                things like GUI interface etc.  Run level 0 is a shutdown of the
                system and Run level 6 reboots the system.</p>
              <p>To set run level you use the init command.  So to change to run
                level 3 run "init 3".  or to reboot the server run "init 6".  In
                order to see what run level you are at run "runlevel".      </p>

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a href="Linux_Networking.html">My
                  Linux networking page</a> has lots of networking information
                and information on more complex configuration settings. 
                Including interface bonding and routing between interfaces.</div>
              <a href="Linux_Networking.html"><span style="color: #333333;"></span></a>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP
                  Configuration</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By default the interfaces detected
                during the installation are set to DHCP.  If you need to use
                static address you can set them by editing the network
                configuration file or files depending on the Linux distribution.
                You can also use the GUI and NetworkManager.  You can run
                ifconig with no options and it will show the IPs for each
                interface on the system.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Routing</span></p>
                <p>By default you have routes to the local networks the system
                  is attached to.  The default setting also prevent the system
                  routing packets between networks if you have multiple
                  interfaces attached to different networks.  If you are using
                  DHCP most likely you also received a default route for all
                  systems not on the local networks.  If you are using static
                  IPs you can add a default route to the interface configuration
                  file.  </p>
                <p>You can view the routing table with "netstat -r" this will
                  show all the basic routes on the system.  You can also use the
                  route command to add routes by hand although all the routes
                  added by hand will disappear when the networking service is
                  restarted.  With more complex networks you may want to have
                  static routing tables that can be automatically enabled when
                  an interface comes up.</p>
                <p>The iptables package allows for much more complex routing and
                  NATing.  iptables gives you much of the functionality of a
                  router.  With iptables you can route based on source address
                  detestation address. you can have rules for NATing certain
                  address or all traffic out or in to an interface.  iptables
                  also lets you block traffic based on rules (i.e. block ssh
                  packets for all non-local traffic or form certain inerfaces).
                        </p>
              </div>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">DNS
                  client and resolving host names</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The "/etc/host" file contains a
                local list of names to IP address.  If you are using you system
                as a server, you should set a static IP and add the IP to the
                host file with the name of the system.  Many Linux packages look
                in the host file for the system name. You can also use the host
                file for aliases to local systems and on the internet.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The host lookup process also uses
                another file "/etc/resolv.conf".  If you are running DHCP this
                is set to the nameserver DHCP supplies.  The resolv.conf file
                contains 2 things; a list of nameservers and it can also include
                a default domain to use if one is not supplied (i.e systemA
                becomes systemA.mydomain.net during DNS lookups).</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">    "/etc/resolv.conf" file example</p>

                                nameserver 192.168.1.1<br />
                                nameserver 8.8.8.8</span><br />
              <br />
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To lookup a host in DNS you run
                "dig" or "nslookup".  To see the details of a domain such as the
                administrators info and primary name servers run "whois". </div>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file has a
                line to set the host lookup order.  This is normally set to
                "hosts:  files dns" where it looks up host names in the local
                "/etc/host" file first then DNS. The order can be changed or you
                can add things like local db, or NIS.  </p>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Users, Groups and Passwords</span><br />
              <p>Linux by default has user levels the highest level is the
                "root".  For a secure system it is recommended that you do not
                log in as root and have a user name.</p>
              <p>Linux uses several files to store user and group information. 
                the user information is in /etc/passwd, the group information is
                stored in /etc/group and the encrypted passwords and account
                expiration information is stored in /etc/shadow.</p>
              <p>The format of the password file is Username, password or X for
                shadow file, UserID, GroupID, comment, home DIR, login shell. 
                The following is for my user "frank"</p>
              <p>    <span style="font-style: italic;">frank:x:500:500:Frank
                  Sundstrom:/home/frank:/bin/bash</span></p>
              <p>The group file has the groups and users assigned to each group.
                The group file tends not to use passwords although the field
                exist.  The format of the group file is Group_Name, Password,
                GroupID, Users_In_Group.  The following are the 2 entries for my
                user frank it is in it's own user group and the users group.</p>
                 <span style="font-style: italic;"> frank:x:500<br />
                    users:x:100:frank</span><br />
              <br />
              You can add a user with an already encrypted password with the
              following commands that I use in scripts setting up new systems. 
              In this way the passwords are not in plain text.  This also
              specifies the group and user IDs so it is the same on all
              systems.  In reality I read the users, groups and passwords from a
              file and add more then one user at a time.<br />
