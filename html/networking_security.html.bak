              <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Security</span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security ?</span></p>
              <p>I have been doing this for over 20 years and know that there is
                no such thing as a secure system unless you lock it in an RF
                shielded steel room with no outside access, an armed guard and
                don't let anyone use it. Not a very practical solution so by
                default we always will have security risk.  Even encryption
                cannot be trusted you always hear that some new standard will
                fix everything until you read an article on how someone found a
                way to decrypt the data or break into the protocol.  Not to
                mention social engineering where you just ask for access or a
                password.  What you need to do is weigh the risk vs what can be
                done to prevent the issue vs how practical it is.</p>
              Ok so we can not have a secure system although we can take
              reasonable steps to have reasonably secure systems.<br />
              <h3>Best Practices </h3>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep everything patched:</span> 
                This is obvious but necessary especially with VPNs, firewalls
                and servers on the internet. </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stay informed: </span> Knowing
                what the threats are is one of the best prevention measures. 
                Subscribe to security newsletters and check security web sites
                on a regular basis </p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Passwords:</span>  Don’t
                keep the same password on you systems for years as this
                increases the chance that someone my get the password. Just
                changing you passwords every couple of months greatly reduces
                risk.  Also use good passwords, random charters are best but as
                no one can remember them this means that it is more likely it is
                written down some ware.  I like to string several words together
                with numbers, upper/lower case and symbols in a way that kind of
                makes sense and I can remember.</p>
              <p>Don't save passwords in your browser, FTP program, phone, etc. 
                If someone gets access to you device  they now can access those
                resources.  If you must store passwords use a secure program
                with more than 256 bit encryption to do so.</p>
              <p>You can also add secure ID devices to login mechanisms.  Where
                you have to have a number that is constantly changing along with
                your login to access the system.  At this time this is the best
                security method as even if someone gets the login information it
                is no longer valid when they try to use it, assuming they don't
                steal the secure ID device.   </p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limit access:</span>  This
                is one of the simplest steps and can have a great effect.  You
                see networks all the time where they let all traffic in and rely
                on system security.  This gives an attacker a much better chance
                of gaining access to a system that may not have correct patches,
                was not set up correctly, has a simple password, etc.  By
                limiting access to only what is needed you greatly reduce risk.
              </p>
              <p> Use the 2 completely separate networks model where
                applicable.  Where you isolate internet or public data traffic
                form administration traffic.  You don’t allow public access to
                systems that don’t need it just by not connecting them to the
                public network.  For systems that do need public network access
                like a router you have a separate physical interface or VLAN for
                admin access and don’t even have a way to login form the public
                network.  The same for things like SQL servers etc. only allow
                access to the required services on the public network and have a
                separate physical interface attached to a separate network for
                administration and system login.   <br />
                <br />
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Router access lists:</span> 
                This approach is unlike a firewall as this stops all traffic
                except the networks or systems you want to have access to your
                network.  By default firewalls let traffic through if they think
                that the inside systems started the conversation.  Firewalls
                also are doing more processing of the packet data and use more
                resources. Where telling a router only let X.X.X.X through or
                not to let certain subnets or ports through completely blocks
                traffic and as all the router is looking at is the Protocol,  IP
                address and maybe the port it does not require that much
                processing power.  At the least you should block you own subnets
                (you know that you should not see traffic coming from internal
                address) at the router and lower ports that you are not using 
                (e.g. block all ports less than 1024 except for port 80 to
                x.x.x.x).</p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Firewalls:</span> 
                Preferably setup on the border between the internal network and
                the internet to limit outside traffic.  You also may want to
                have internal firewalls between users and servers.  If you need
                internet access you have to all IPs through the router except
                for a black hole list or other security threats (I do cheat here
                and filter some non US address, you know the countries to block
                if possible).  Set up the firewall to only allow what you need
                and nothing else.</p>
              <p> It is suggested to block access to ports and sites that allow
                remote access to systems like gotomypc.com as you want users
                logging in through a secure VPN connection.</p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">VPNs:</span>  Use VPNs for
                access to internal systems form the internet as this gives an
                added level of security.  Don’t just open a hole in the firewall
                for your exchange server or systems you may need outside access
                to.  Only open a hole to a VPN server and use that for internal
                access.  This adds a level of security and encrypts all the
                data.  In many cases you may also want to set up internal VPNs
                for access to a computer center or systems with sensitive data. 
                VPNs are a great security tool for limiting access to multiple
                systems.  The best VPN servers use a secure ID device that has a
                constantly changing code along with you login so you are not
                using the same access code all the time.</p>
              <p>It is also suggested to use VPNs with high encryption settings
                over 256 bits to connect remote sites as this adds security and
                encryption to the traffic.  It is also a good practice to have
                an access list on the firewall or router to only allow IPs of
                you remote systems access to your VPN.   </p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Proxy servers:</span> Can
                help with security as you can set up rules and local systems
                only need to have access to the proxy server not the whole
                internet.  Proxy servers are also a point of concern as it gives
                an intruder a centralized system with all traffic.  I have mixed
                feelings about proxy servers, if done right they can help in
                many ways and if done wrong they can cause big security issues. 
                The 2 major issues you need to be careful with is unauthorized
                data access as all the data is going through the server and
                cache poisoning.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WiFi: </span> It is best to
                set up wifi as an external network and require users to use VPNs
                etc. to access internal systems.  Wifi is very similar to an
                internet link were it is publicly accessible if the passwords
                are hacked or acquired via social engineering. </p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intrusion detection systems:</span> 
                IDS and IPS are very useful as they just passively monitor
                traffic and with the later intrusion prevention system react to
                threats.  You can get a nice report as to what issues you may
                have. </p>
              <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Traffic monitoring:</span>
                General traffic monitoring is not only good for finding network
                issues it also is a good security tool.  Look for unusual
                activity, services on strange ports and changes in trends.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Port and IP Scanning:</span> 
                Run Frequent port and IP scans on you internal network and from
                outside the firewall looking for changes.  Also look for scans
                form other systems.  Most intrusion detection systems will
                report scanning activity.  It is also a good idea to run
                vulnerability scanners on you network form outside just like
                hackers would.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Virus and Malware software</span>: 
                It is suggested to Install Virus and Malware detection software
                on any systems that access your network.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security policies:</span> 
                Have a security policy so people know what is expected.  This
                can be a great help to securing your network, as this gives
                everyone guidelines to follow.</p>
