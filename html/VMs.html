                  Systems</span></h2>
              <p>Today we can not talk about computer systems without including
                virtualization.  We are going to go over several solutions.  The
                most common and mainstream is VMware's vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)
                which is available as a free version for a limited number of
                processors.  Vmware's ESXi runs under a modified version of
                Linux witch is hidden from the user unless you turn on SSH
                access. </p>
              <p>I no longer use my computer to access the web directly.  With
                all the security issues we have today, I use VMware player on my
                PC and run a disposable virtual version of windows.  I also have
                a system with VMware ESXi running that I have a variety of
                Operating systems on for development and testing along with this
                web server running on CentOS.  Another great advantage of
                Virtual systems is the ease of backup and restore.  </p>
              <p>Other common vitalization software includes Oracle VirtualBox,
                Xzen and KVM.</p>
              <h3>VMware ESXi</h3>
              <p>VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) has a free license option that
                supports a limited number of cores.  This is a full featured
                VMware server it just has limited number of CPUs and cores
                supported witch is fine if you are running it on a single
                process system.  This site is running on VMware ESXi 5.5 and
                there are many other VMs running at the same time with no
                issues.</p>
              <p><br />
                To get started I would recommend at least 6 Gig of ram and a 2
                core processor.  VMware 5.5 will not run with 4 gig of RAM form
                my experience.  You can run older versions with less RAM
                although more RAM is better with VMware.  In most cases I am
                looking for 12 gig or more of RAM.  VMware is also very good at
                recovering unused memory so if you have 5 systems running with
                2Gig each and some are not doing much (i.e. the OS is not using
                all the ram) you can be using a total of 6Gig or so Gig of the
                RAM in the system.</p>
              <p><br />
                VMware has great monitoring tools to monitor RAM and CPU usage
                for the total system or just one VM.  This makes it very easy to
                decide on what system resources are needed.  VMware also runs
                best with at least 2 disk drives one for VMware and one for
                VMs.  Disk IO is the big bottleneck with VMware systems and
                having a good RAID or SANs storage array can really help
                performance.</p>
              <p><br />
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting started with VMware</span></p>
              <p>To get running you need to load the server on a 64 bit system
                with at least 6 Gig of memory for EXSi 5.5.  after you load the
                server set up the IP (I recommend a static IP for the server as
                you need to attach to it with the client software).</p>
              <p><br />
                Next load the client software on your desktop or admin system. 
                Now you can connect to the server with the remote system.  Once
                you log in you will have access to the main VMware GUI
                interface.  When first loaded the system as a trial license for
                some time this has some very high number of cores it will
                support (at least 32 by default).  Once you load the free
                license this will go down to 8 and of course you can always buy
                a license with more cores and CPUs. </p>
              <p><br />
                Now we are ready to create a VM (Virtual Machine).  You do this
                just like you would load a standard server of desktop although I
                recommend having an ISO image on the client system.  You can
                also load the ISO on the VMware server for well used install
                disk or if you are remote with a slow link between you and the
                server.  VMware will also load VMs form your local CD/DVD ROM
                drive.  VMware also has the ability to load and save OVF (Open
                Virtualization Format) files.  This is a good way to save you VM
                with all the setting Etc. and load it later or on a different
                VMware server.</p>
              <p>   <br />
                To create a new VM go to file new virtual machine you can use
                the typical setting for ease of use or custom.  Go through the
                setting (they are quite self-explanatory) and create your new
                VM.  You can always go back and make changes later.  Next power
                it on and mount you ISO image.  From there it is just like
                loading any other system. </p>
              <p><br />
                Common things to change are things like setting up a 2nd
                interface on the server with a virtual switch for the VMs to
                use.  You can even have tagged VLANS running into the hardware
                interface and set port access to the systems just like any other
                switch.  You can also get virtual switch add-ons from major
                switch manufactures to mimic the rest of you network.  You can
                connect a limited number or supported USB devices to the VMs. 
                One thing I do is set the number of cores to 2 or more for many
                types of VMs and many OSs run better with more than one core.</p>
              <p><br />
                That’s it for basic setup.  You can have very complex setups
                with many virtual switches networks, routers, load balancers,
                traffic simulators, Etc. all on one VMware server.  To simulate
                very large telco environments with multiple sites and services,
                I run blade servers with many VMs and have complex routing
                including delays and network traffic issues.   <br />
