              <h4>Intel Servers</h4>
              In most cases Linux will be installed on Intel based systems. 
              Linux can handle multiple processors with multiple cores.  The
              Linux kernel handles this very well and in fact it runs best on 2
              or more cores.  most versions support at least 32 cores for 32bit
              systems and 64 for 64bit systems.  Beyond that you need to check
              the version that you want to run.  In practice you are unlikely to
              go beyond this limit unless you have a special need.  The newer
              64bit kernel can support 2048 cores as I write this, although I
              only know of one system by SGI that has that many cores.<br />
              <br />
              Intel processors run up to 4.4 GHz and have up to 8 cores.  The
              Atom and Celeron support a max of 2 cores, The Core i processors
              support a max of 4 cores, and the Xeon and Itanium found in
              servers have up to 8 cores.<br />
              <br />
              When you start to go above 8 cores in total, memory size and speed
              become a big performance issues as much as the number of CPUs or
              cores.  The first thing is that you want the fastest memory
              available in large systems so the CPUs are not waiting for data
              access.  Next is memory size, you need to be able to use all the
              processing power and if what needs to be processed is not in
              memory the CPUs will not be fully utilized.  To support 16 or so
              cores you would want lots of memory about 32 Gig.  A good
              guideline is at least 1-2Gig of memory per core, plus overhead. 
              The amount of memory depends upon what applications you are
              running.  Where if you have a large database system you would want
              double, quadruple or more then the above guideline as caching,
              number of processes and connections come in to affect.  If the
              system is just routing packets or calculating formulas you would
              not need a lot of memory.  <br />
              <br />
              Blade centers are becoming common as it lets us have more
              computers in less space.  Blade Centers have management advantages
              as the remote KVM and power switching is built in.  They also have
              cntrlized power and switches so we don't require the same amount
              of wiring as individual computers.  From my experience in large
              data centers I would recommend the HP Bladeservers over IBM as I
              have seen lots of hardware issues with IBM Blade Centers.<br />
              <br />
              Their are also companies like Supermicro that make cheaper blade
              systems. These do not have all the features that the big boys have
              such as hot swapping, built in KVMs, switches, etc. But they do
              give you a good high density suoution that is very affordable. <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Interfaces</span><br />
              <br />
              Not all network cards are created equal.  You can get network
              cards with checksum and segmentation offloading witch will
              increase speed on busy servers.  Also the amount of buffering may
              be of concern in some cases.<br />
              <br />
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Non Intel computers.  </span><br />
              <br />
              In most cases this would be a small single board computer like the
              Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone.  As well as many others used for
              robotics or imbedded systems like home routers and other
              appliances.  Most of these use the ARM processor and a memory card
              as the disk drive.   <br />
