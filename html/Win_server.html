              </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choosing the right system
                  architecture</span></p>
              First is choosing winch version of windows server is best for your
              needs.  Windows server comes in many flavors.  The 2 main concerns
              are what the system is going to be used for and preexisting
              software.  The 64 bit versions are faster although your 32bit
              software may not run on a 64bit system and if it does it may not
              make total use of the system.  Spend some time researching the
              options based on you needs and budget. <br />
              <br />
              The next concern is uptime.  Whether you have a small business or
              are running a large web site uptime is an issue.  Windows has
              clustering built into the OS to provide redundancy and it works
              quite well.  For internet services such as mail and web servers
              you want to have VIPs (virtual IP addresses) so when one system
              goes down the VIP switches to another server.  You may also want
              to have some type of load balancers setup disturbing the load to
              multiple servers in an N+1 architecture. <br />
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hardware Platform<br />
                </span></p>
              <p>The next question is what platform are you going to run you
                server on.  In many cases the best choice is to virtualize the
                server.  This has many advantages including; easy backups,
                ability to migrate to other platforms and easy hardware
                expansion when more processing power is needed.</p>
              <p>The major disadvantage to virtualization is the overhead of the
                virtualization software.  So in general it will require more
                horsepower to run the same system as a VM then if you installed
                it natively on the same platform.  The other problem we run into
                with vitalization is that not all hardware works well on a VM
                platform specifically IO devices. </p>
              <p>The Newer versions of windows server 2008 and 2012 handle
                multiple cores very well and in fact I would not run the newer
                versions of windows on a single core system as it can cause
                bottlenecks.  </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server Roles</span></p>
              <p>In planning your environment you need to decide what server
                roles are needed and if you want one server for all the needed
                roles of multiple servers handling different roles.  For example
                you could buy a high end server with multiple 8 way processors
                and gigs of memory and set up one server with IIS, DNS, Active
                Directory, exchange ... Although if you have heavy use of all
                the services you may still have IO issues etc. </p>
              <p>IIS is windows web server and works quite well as long as other
                task don't take up too many resources (FYI: Although IIS works
                just fine I do recommend running Linux and Apache for web
                servers where feasible).  So if you also want to run a busy
                Exchange and Active Directory service it may make sense to have
                the IIS on a separate system.  Also note that even if you have
                these services on the same system if can help a great deal to
                assign the services their own IPs.  This way each main service
                has its own IP stack, so for instance if you have a lot of web
                users with hung sessions or the web site gets a DOS attack, 
                your other services will still be available.</p>
              <p>So in general it is recommended that mission critical services
                run on their own servers.  This way issues with another service
                will not affect your core requirements. </p>
