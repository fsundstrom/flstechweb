              <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network routing</span></h2>
              <p>We will go over the most common routing methods, although there
                are many routing protocols that will not be covered.  This gives
                a good overview of the most common network routing scenarios. 
                Routing can be very complex and there are many books and sites
                that just covering IP routing.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Top Level routing ASNs and BGP</span></p>
              <p>The top level of routing is Autonomous System routing.  AS
                routing sets polices for large blocks of IPs (Autonomous
                Systems) each AS is assigned a 32bit number (ASN) that is
                managed by iana.org.  ASes are designed so it is easy to reroute
                large segments of IP address to multiple nodes for load
                balancing and redundancy.  In most cases the nodes are in
                different locations allowing for site fail-overs.  Only ISPs,
                large companies and Universities use ASNs. As with IP addresses,
                there are also ranges of AS numbers that are reserved for
                private use and can be used on large internal networks for
                fail-over and load balancing. <br />
              </p>
              <p>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the method used for routing
                ASNs.  Each router on the edge of the internal network runs BGP
                and advertises its routes and receives routes via the BGP
                protocol.  BGP is normally set up in a mesh where each router on
                the edge of the internal network has routes to the other BGP
                members with the same ASN.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OSPF (Open Shortest Path
                  First) routing</span></p>
              <p>OSPF is the most common routing protocol for internal networks
                within an ASN.  The main advantage to OSPF is that it uses
                metrics for routes so if one route has 3 hops to the destination
                and the other path only has one hop it knows to send the traffic
                through the shortest path.  This is very useful when you want to
                have redundancy in the network.  As OSPF will generally avoid
                circular routes and pick the best path. OSPF also has a link
                state with the connected routers so it knows if a port goes down
                and routes around the problem.  </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RIP (Routing Information
                  Protocol) </span></p>
              <p>RIP is only suited for small local networks as it has a lot of
                overhead and relies on the local systems to manage the routing
                tables.  This is ok for small local networks with just a few
                routes/routers. Most computer systems have RIP built into the OS
                so this makes RIP very easy to set up.  </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Static Routes and ICMP
                  redirects.</span></p>
              <p>In most cases systems have a default route to the local
                router.  If you use DHCP to get IP address for your systems it
                also gets a default route in most cases.  The local router (the
                default route) should know about all the systems it routes to
                via routing protocols or static routing tables.  If it gets a
                packet for a system that has a direct route through a router on
                the same local network it will send an ICMP redirect back to the
                sender.  The sender will then process the redirect and add the
                route to the local routing table.  All preceding packets for
                that host will now go directly to the gateway in the ICMP
                redirect.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnets</span></p>
              <p>The use of subnets lets us divide large blocks of IP address
                into smaller blocks for routing to local networks. The details
                of subnetting are on the <a href="networking_IPs.html">IP
                  address</a> page.  When using subnets we need to make sure all
                the systems on the local network have the same subnet settings. 
                You can route larger blocks of address to a local router that
                are then broken down into smaller subnets on local LANs as long
                as they are not part of the subnet the local system is on.  </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Example</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We have a 10.0.0.0 class A network.
                The local system has an 8 bit mask (255.255.255.0) and an IP of
                10.1.100.1.  You can have a route for 10.20.0.0 with a 16 bit
                mask (255.255.0.0), but not 10.1.0.0 as that would include you
                address.  You could have a default route that would include all
                address except you local network, or multiple class C routes
                10.1.102.0 etc.  </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ARP (Address Resolution
                  Protocol)</span></p>
              <p>ARP is the lowest level of routing and is used on Ethernet to
                associate an IP (IPv4 as IPv6 uses neighbor discovery) with a
                MAC (media access control address) on the local network card. 
                When a system wants to send data to an IP address on the local
                network it sends out a brodcast ARP request.  The system with
                that IP responds with an ARP reply.  The system making the ARP
                request then adds the MAC to a local ARP table so it knows what
                MAC address to send packets with that IP to.  </p>
              <p>This works great until we start using virtual IPs and the IP
                changes what interface it is on.  Now the local system has the
                incorrect MAC for the IP and it looks like the VIP address is
                down.  Eventually the system will expire the ARP entry and
                resend the ARP request and it starts working again.  Systems
                that did not have the old ARP table entry will work file.  This
                can be confusing and causes many issues.  Better implementations
                of VIP use ARP announcements broadcast to all systems on the
                local network when the interface changes. </p>
              <p>The other issues that can occur with ARP are when you have 2
                computers with the same IP.  The last response gets put into the
                ARP table, and it can flip between systems.  With today's
                systems it is also possible to change the MAC address on many
                systems and you can have more then one system with the same MAC,
                although not as common a problem it can cause big issues.</p>
