              <h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">My prototype rover R1D1
                                                <br />
                </span></h1>
              This is R1D1 (rev1 droid 1) and is designed to be an autonomous
              robot or rover, not just a remote controlled toy.  After watching
              a NOVA program on drones I decided to build one except that this
              is a rover not a flyer.  I thought this would be useful as it can
              go fetch stuff for me.<br />
              <br />
              I am building this from scratch and not using kits or precaned
              software, as I will learn more this way and may come up with
              something new.  It has a lightweight aluminum chassis and 4 wheel
              drive system with 2 gear reduction motors.  The electronics
              consist of an Arduino microcontroller board for basic I/O and
              analog to digital conversion and a Raspberry Pi a small single
              board Linux system for the brains.  The Raspberry Pi has a WiFi
              adapter and runs a web server for communications over XML.<br />
              <br />
              This is still in the development phase and in the end it will have
              an outside cover to protect electrons and drive form the elements.
              As well as a place to transport items (i.e a tray) and an arm. So
              what we are looking at is the robot base. I am going to start with
              mistakes and things that worked well.  As it always helps to see
              what others have done good and bad.  Next we will go into the
              details of the design and systems.  
              <h4> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Things That Worked<br />
                </span></h4>
              First I put an easy to reach on/off toggle switch on the outside. 
              This has been very useful as when you have coding bugs with robots
              they can go out of control. Having a separate Linux system works
              very well as it has high level languages and the ability to run
              multiple process.  The Raspberry Pi is running a version of Debian
              so it has a large software base and runs most Linux packages. 
              Where the Arduino is very good at one thing I/O.  The big wheels
              are great as it does not get stuck.  The size is also good as it
              is not too big the width is 14 inches.  It has a bank of LEDs
              controlled by the Arduino.  This has been very useful for
              debugging as the LEDs can indicate the status of several things.<br />
              <h4> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Not So Good Stuff<br />
                </span></h4>
              This is the 2nd design as the first design had some issues with
              the propulsion system.  I used 2 car electric seat motors and did
              not have enough gear reduction.  The gearing is a big issue with
              larger robots and it is always better to have a slower robot that
              has more than enough power then a faster robot that has power
              issues.  I also did not have enough degrees of warp on the drive
              gear and when the chain got looser I had slipping issues.  The new
              ver has an idler gear to solve this issue.  <br />
              <br />
              I started with the Arduino UNO and ran out of I/O pins, so I had
              to switch to the Mega.  This one is not a mistake it is just that
              now you can get an all in one board with the Raspberry and a built
              in Arduino.  So I was not to only one to come up with this
              design.  <br />
              <h4> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic design</span></h4>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power</span><br />
              <br />
              The rover is powered by a 12 volt gel lead-acid battery.  This
              gives a lot or current and holds <br />
              a charge well.  The 12 volt leads are attached to the motor
              controller and the motor controller is sending power to the
              Arduino board (microcontroller).  I also have a modified USB car
              charger to power the Raspberry Pi Linux board with a usb cable. 
              Charging is very simple at this time and I am using a current
              limiting resistor in line with a plug in 12 volt adapter with an
              output of about 14v.  Also note the big power toggle switch on the
              back to disconnect the battery as coding bugs can cause a run
              away.  <br />
              <br />
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer and Microcontroller </span>
                    <br />
              <br />
              The rover is using a raspberry pi single board Linux system for
              all the logic and higher level decision making.  I am using one of
              the USB ports attached to the Arduino microcontroller for I/O
              communions between the 2 systems (this uses a virtual serial
              port).  I have designed a simple command response protocol for
              communications (very similar to using an old modem). <br />
              <br />
              The Raspberry Pi Linux system has more processing power so it is
              doing all the tricky stuff. I have a USB WiFi adapter for network
              access and it is running an Apache web server.  The web server is
              using Perl CGI for basic web pages and XML communications. It has
              a camera that can be displayed on the web page and GPS for
              navigation.  I am working on the navigation code now, where the
              system will use waypoints and tell the Arduino ~ how far to go and
              what direction.  If it gets off course or sees an obstacle the
              navigation system will recompute and start over.  <br />
              <br />
              The Arduino has inputs for the sonic distance sensors and when you
              give it a command to move you can also state a max distance to
              stop at.  The Arduino also has a compass so it can follow a
              heading.   The motors are using 2 of the pulse width modulated
              outputs and a purpose built motor controller (Pololu Dual
              MC33926).  There are opto sensors on the gears to  judge distance
              traveled and speed.  As the Arduino is a real time system and can
              not process 2 things at once, the opto sensors on the gears are
              using interrupt driven inputs to <span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;

                readings</span><br />
              <br />
              Next is bumper sensors also interrupt driven so it will stop
              quickly if it hits something.  <br />
              As the sonic distance sensors are about 95% reliable.  I also need
              to work on permanent mounting for the sonic sensors as I was using
              plywood to work out the sensor array geometry.<br />
              <br />
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hardware</span><br />
              <br />
              The construction is all aluminum to save weight.  The load bearing
              parts are made form aluminum angle iron (What an oxymoron that
              is!) and the main case is an old aluminum T1 modem chassis that
              was just the right size.  The wheels are home depot lawn mower
              wheels.  I used a solid aluminum rod for the wheels to attach to,
              as this reduced the load on the frame.  The frame is just bolted
              together no welds.  Note that some of the components are a little
              long as this is still a prototype and you can’t add metal.  The
              heaviest things are the battery, motors and wheels, the rest of
              the construction is quite light.  I would like lighter wheels and
              am thinging of drilling some holes in them as the rubber is very
              thick and heavy.<br />
              <br />
              Although the drive shafts are solid the wheels have brass bearings
              and are driven individually and not by the shaft.  This allows
              tank like steering, so to turn in a tight circle one set of wheels
              goes forward and one set backwards. Their are also brass bearings
              where the shafts go through the frame to reduce friction even more
              when both sets of wheels are going the same direction.  The wheels
              are held in place by aluminum collars with set screws on the
              inside of the shafts  and a washer with a cotter pin on the
              outside to hold the wheels on.<br />
              <br />
              The Motors are 12V 3A gear reduction with a max speed of ~
              40RPMs.  The chain drive is #25 chain with ¼ pitch.  To give more
              degrees of wrap on the drive gears and for tension adjustment
              there are idler gears on each side.  Each wheel has a gear driven
              by the chain and keyways have been put in the wheels to prevent
              slippage.  The gear ratio is about 1.5 / 1 as the motors are
              relatively slow.  This gives a stable system with a lot of torque.
